1. Create a program that takes pizza orders for Crusty Pizza:
- Include options for pickup or delivery
- If delivery, collect customer name, address, and phone number
- Add $2.50 delivery charge for delivery orders
- If pickup, collect customer name only
- Allow the operator to input up to 5 pizzas
- Present a menu of at least 12 pizza options
- Store the order information
- Regular pizzas cost $8.50, gourmet pizzas cost $5 more
- Display the ordered pizzas, individual prices, total cost, customer name, and delivery address (if applicable)
- Provide a management summary with total pizzas sold and total value
- Display orders in the kitchen from oldest to newest
- Allow the operator to cancel the order

2. Structure the program effectively:
- Use variables to store different data types (e.g. text, numeric, boolean)
- Implement sequence, selection, and iteration control structures
- Use advanced techniques such as:
  - Modifying data in collections (e.g. lists, dictionaries)
  - Creating functions/methods with parameters and return values
  - Responding to GUI events
  - Performing non-basic string manipulation
  - Using additional non-core libraries

3. Document the program:
- Use appropriate variable and module names
- Include comments describing the code's function and behavior
- Follow Python's PEP8 conventions

4. Test and debug the program:
- Ensure it works for expected, boundary, and invalid cases
- Comprehensively test the program and document the process

5. Make the program flexible and robust:
- Use abstractions, functions, and derived values effectively
- Handle invalid input and edge cases properly
- ensure the program is a well-structured, logical response to the task
